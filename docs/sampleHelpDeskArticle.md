# Sample Help Desk Article

**Tools used: Microsoft Word**  
This project is a sample help desk article. 
This example’s audience is consumers using the Pixel 3, a Google phone product. 
The article instructs consumers on how to change their font size.  

# Increasing font size  

Your Pixel 3’s font size setting will not apply to every app. Some apps have their own font settings.

To make your phone’s font larger:

1. Open your Pixel 3’s Settings app.
2. Select Display > Font size.
3. Use the slider to adjust the displayed font size.
