# Sample User Guide

**Tools used: Microsoft Word, Adobe FrameMaker**

I authored and maintained the NAF Connect user guide with 10+ edits since the platform's launch.
You can view the current version of the user guide [here](https://assets.naf-connect.com/assets/docs/NAFConnect%20User%20Guide.pdf). My contributions are tracked after the List of Acronyms.

Check out the PDF of my sample user manual below.
Contact me for a docx version with working cross-references instead!
