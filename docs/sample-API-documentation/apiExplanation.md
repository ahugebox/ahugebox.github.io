# Explanation

An overview of this fake API documentation.

### Where are these APIs from?

**Tools used: Docusaurus, LucidCharts, Swagger GUI, Visual Studio Code**

:::info

The API in this documentation does not exist. It is used for documentation purposes only.
:::

I am using the [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/) for my sample API documentation.
This section showcases how I would structure web-based API documentation and the templates for each API.
It wouldn't be much of a Docusaurus site without some API documentation, would it?

My sample documents the Petstore API and is inspired by [Stripe's documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions).
Each page describes an endpoint and its associated requests.

### Documentation Structure

All good API documentation needs the following pages:

- Overview page
- Getting Started page
- Tutorial page
- Endpoint pages

I could not add a tutorial page without a working API. I created one endpoint page for portfolio purposes,
as creating more of the same content would waste your time. You know what the page would look like.

### These screenshots look strange...

Good API documentation contains screenshots of what is happening in the API.
The Swagger Petstore does not exist outside of Swagger.
Instead, I've taken screenshots of Swagger with appropriate callouts to mimic documentation.
