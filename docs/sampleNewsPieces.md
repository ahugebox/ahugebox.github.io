**Tools used: Microsoft Word**

I've worked as a freelance writer for Jon Peddie Research for about two years and as a ghostwriter for another two.
In total, I've authored over 50 pieces of SEO optimized content. You can view the bulk of my content at [JPR](https://gfxspeak.com/author/tristanjonpeddie-com/).
Here are a few of my greatest hits:

- [The Love/Hate Relationship of NFTs in AAA Games](https://gfxspeak.com/featured/relationship-triple-games/)
- [Unity and IronSource Officially Complete Their $4.4 Billion Merger](https://gfxspeak.com/featured/ironsource-officially-complete/)
- [Campfire Ignites XR in the Workplace](https://gfxspeak.com/newswatch/campfire-ignites-xr-in-the-workplace/)
