# Fantasy’s Finest: The Alloy of Law by Brandon Sanderson

```
People today… it seems they are good, or sometimes evil, mostly by inertia, not by choice.
They act as their surroundings prepare them to act.

## Plot

The genre “fantasy” doesn’t do The Alloy of Law justice.
It mashes a solid detective story with table-flipping, gunslinging action in an era where magic and technology intersect.
Any fantasy fan who is looking for the right blend of pulpy fights
begging you to turn the page and a character-driven plot with high stakes, pick
up the nearest copy of The Alloy of Law. This book is an excellent 10/10.

Wax works as a lawman in the gritty Western plains and dust until he loses the love of his life to an insane bandit. In this slump, he trudges back to his noble family to do his duties of finding a wife and caring for the family business. But when a group of thieves called the Vanishers kidnap his new fiancée Steris—kind of, it’s weird—Wax must teach the lawman and the noble in him to cooperate to save her.

Unlike many fantasy novels, the plot is driven by the main cast of characters. Our main three protagonists attend a noble’s dinner party to serve their needs, but Steris is captured. Then Wax’s best friend Wayne breaks into a police station dressed as a constable to pursue a lead. These characters never feel shunted into a plot to follow. Wax, Wayne, and Marasi are competent detectives and proactively pursue leads and create opportunities for themselves, making the plot’s tempo feel like it progresses at break-neck speed, leaving the reader to want more action. Publishers Weekly called the book “part Sherlock Holmes, part X-Men,” and they’re right.

```
“I was a little busy being shot at.”

“Busy? Aw, mate. It doesn’t take any effort at all to get shot at.”
```

## Feminism and representation

If you rolled your eyes to the book’s classic damsel-in-distress plot, I understand. The structure infantilizes women, and the fantasy genre is infamous for giving women awful story lines. The Alloy Of Law isn’t reductive in that way. Marasi, Steris’s cousin studying Criminal Justice, actively contributes to the investigation and never finds a problem with being feminine in a traditionally masculine line of work. While other characters are surprised, nobody insults her for doing so.

Marasi holds her own in the shoot-outs and does great detective work. While she is an exception to the rule in her society, the characters don’t remind you of it. When you’re in the thick of the book, Marasi, Wax, and Wayne are all peers in their investigation and Sanderson proves that fighting crime is gender-neutral with plot and action, not empty maxims.

## Conclusion

The world is built on top of Sanderson’s original Mistborn trilogy, but new readers don’t need to start with the first series. Whereas Mistborn is high fantasy complete with stone keeps and magic assassins, The Alloy of Law mixes the grit of a Western story with the same magic system. Drive to your local bookstore and pick up a copy of this 5/5 story.
